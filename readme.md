RPatch
======

RPatch is a simple-to-use library for Android that provides a new twist on the Android [NinePatch](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/NinePatch.html).

RPatch uses the powerful and familiar single-image format employed by NinePatch, but allows you to specify reptition behavior on the middle and edge patches.

**TODO**: Lots of example images!
